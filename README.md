System for an S&amp;P 500 Index Rebalancing Trading Strategy

This script aims to replicate a trading strategy of buying a put when a constituent stock is deleted from the S&P 500 index. Conversely, it buys a call when a constituent stock is added to the index.

The methodology can be found in the post - "Index Rebalancing Is STILL a Rain-Maker Trade." @ [The Quant's Playbook](https://quantgalore.substack.com/)
